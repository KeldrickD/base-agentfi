# Base AgentFi

Framework for building **autonomous AI DeFi agents** on **Base** using Coinbase's **Agentic Wallets** (launched Feb 11, 2026).

Agents can:
- Hold & manage tokenized RWAs (inspired by my previous RWA Lending Vault)
- Auto-lend/borrow/compound yield
- Monitor & prevent liquidations
- Execute gasless trades/payments via x402 + ERC-4337
- All with programmable guardrails

**Why?** Base is pushing AI agents hard - Agentic Wallets give agents standalone wallets for spending, earning, trading with security controls. This project explores that + RWA/DeFi use cases.

**Tech stack (planned)**
- Solidity 0.8.24 + Foundry
- Base Sepolia / Mainnet
- Coinbase Agentic Wallets (via awal CLI / skills integration)
- Chainlink Automation / Functions (for triggers)
- ERC-4337 account abstraction

**Status:** Early setup - contracts, tests, and integration coming soon.

Built by @xkldrckx | Open to feedback / collabs.
